{"name":"Phylogenetic Tree","tagline":"","body":"### Welcome to Phylogenetic Tree\r\nPhylogenetics gives the similarities and divergence among related biological sequences. The proposed tool can be used to do multiple sequence alignment and also for constructing the phylogenetic tree by using generated sequence alignment. The tool accepts the input sequence which is in FASTA (.fasta) format and generated output file also is in FASTA format only. \r\n\r\nIt requires minimum three sequence files for construction of phylogenetic tree. Either we can import the sequence or we \r\ncan get the sequence file by using the accession number of the sequences. The application gives two types of graphs to view phylogenetic tree which includes rectangular graph and circular graph. After construction we can also save the generated graph for future use.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages?
